    "Overall summary: Boreal forests are home to many mobility-impeding terrains that would make off-road auonomous navigation challenging. This paper introduces BorealTC, and publicly available dataset for proprioceptive-based terrain classification (TC). This data was recorded with a HuskyA200, and it contains 116 minutes of data from the following sensors: \n",
    "- inertial measurement unit (IMU)\n",
    "- motor current \n",
    "- wheel odom \n",
    "\n",
    "It contains data from the following terrain types: \n",
    "- Snow \n",
    "- Ice \n",
    "- Silty loam (it's like soil)\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors evaluate the following models: \n",
    "- CNN \n",
    "- State space model Mamba architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "Key results: \n",
    "- CNN outperforms Mamba on each separate dataset, Mamba achieves better accuracy in combined daaset \n",
    "- Mamba's learning capacity is greater for larger amounts of data "
